PostScript::ScheduleGrid
========================

PostScript::ScheduleGrid is a Perl module that creates a printable schedule of events (using PostScript) in a grid format often used for TV listings.  You supply the schedule data.  If you're producing actual TV listings, the [PostScript::ScheduleGrid::XMLTV](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?PostScript::ScheduleGrid::XMLTV) module (distributed separately) can be used to get the schedule data from [XMLTV](http://xmltv.org/).


This is a Git repository where development of PostScript::ScheduleGrid takes place.  For more information, visit [PostScript::ScheduleGrid on CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/dist/PostScript-ScheduleGrid/).
